2,Federal,2006,"Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England is a case presided over by the Supreme Court involving a facial challenge to New Hampshire's parental notification abortion law. The First Circuit had ruled that the law was unconstitutional and an injunction against its enforcement was proper. The Supreme Court vacated this judgment and remanded the case, but avoided a substantive ruling on the challenged law or a reconsideration of prior Supreme Court abortion precedent; it only addressed the issue of remedy, holding that invalidating a statute in its entirety ""is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief.""",3.226813885,79.62806412

6,Kentucky,2016,"Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. is a Supreme Court case dealing with the constitutionality of a 2016 anti-abortion law passed in the state of Indiana. Indiana's law sought to ban abortions performed solely on the basis of the fetus' gender, race, ethnicity, or disabilities. Lower courts had blocked enforcement of the law for violating a woman's right to abortion under privacy concerns within the Fourteenth Amendment, as previously found in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The lower courts also blocked enforcement of another portion of the law that required the disposal of aborted fetuses through burial or cremation. The per curiam decision by the Supreme Court overturned the injunction on the fetal disposal portion of the law, but otherwise did not challenge or confirm the lower courts' ruling on the non-discrimination clauses, leaving these in place",0.178832681,511.2549073

As the infrastructure was not in place for these new requirements, the two abortion clinics operating in Kentucky shut down, making abortion de facto illegal in the state. In response, abortion-rights activists sued the state to challenge the law, with Planned Parenthood and the ACLU stating that the law unconstitutionally bans abortion by introducing requirements that can't be followed or are too arduous to comply with and that it violates patient privacy protections. The law is blocked in federal court later in 2022",0.178832681,511.2549073
